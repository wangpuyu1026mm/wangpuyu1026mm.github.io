I am currently an Alexander von Humboldt Research Fellow in the Machine Learning Group at RPTU Kaiserslauternâ€“Landau, Germany, led by [Prof. Marius Kloft](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l-BJCdAAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to this fellowship, I held research positions as a Senior Research Assistant and a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Hong Kong Baptist University and City University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of [Prof. Ding-Xuan Zhou](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/dingxuan-zhou.html) and [Prof. Jun Fan](https://www.math.hkbu.edu.hk/~junfan/). I received my Ph.D.\ in Statistics from Northwest University, China, and I spent one year as a visiting PhD student at the State University of New York at Albany, supervised by [Prof. Yiming Ying](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/yiming-ying.html).

## Research Interests

My research interests lie in statistical learning theory and machine learning, with an emphasis on deep learning theory, optimization, and differential privacy. I am particularly interested in both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of modern machine learning, especially in the development and analysis of machine learning algorithms.
